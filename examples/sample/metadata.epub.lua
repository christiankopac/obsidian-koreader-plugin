Use the back side of the To Do Today sheet, and rotate it 90 degrees so it is in landscape orientation. Now you’re ready to explore your mind in order to grasp at the most usable knowledge concluded today.\
This is how I do the next step: in the middle of the paper, I draw a picture of my daily subject. What’s my daily subject? What have I been communicating most with colleagues today? What’s the keyword of the activity with most Xs drawn today? What was the subject of the meetings I went to today? What tool did I use in a new way today? Those are a lot of questions with possibly many answers. I have to choose one single thing as my daily subject. I pick the first one that pops up in mind and that feels outstanding in some aspect.\
Then I draw an ordinary mind map with colored branches, small icons, and free associations. When the timer rings, I just put the To Do Today sheet with my daily mind map into my pile of past daily mind maps.

However, if breaks are too long, then you will lose the rhythm. Every Pomodoro start will feel like starting on a new activity. If you skip breaks, on the other hand, then quality will fall.

Below the title I can add diagrams, phone numbers, web addresses, or anything else relevant to complete this activity.

Planning: You start the day by extracting the most important activities from your backlog—called the Activity Inventory—and writing them in a list on your To Do Today sheet. This is your commitment for the day.\
Tracking: Once you’ve decided on your activities for the day, you wind up the timer for 25 minutes and then start in on the first one. During every 25-minute timebox—called a Pomodoro—you collect a small amount of process metrics. You may, for example, count the number of times that you get interrupted.\
Recording: At the end of the day, you file your daily observations on the Records sheet. If you tracked the number of interruptions, then this number is saved here.\
Processing: After recording, you convert the raw data into information. For example, you might calculate how many interruptions you get in an average 25-minute timebox.\
Visualizing: Finally, you organize the information in a way that helps you see how to improve your process. This is basically a daily retrospective and when you acclimatize your working habits to your reality.\
Every day starts with the Planning stage and ends with Recording, Processing, and Visualizing stages. In between, there is an iterative loop of 25-minute Tracking sessions.",

Planning: You start the day by extracting the most important activities from your backlog—called the Activity Inventory—and writing them in a list on your To Do Today sheet. This is your commitment for the day.\
Tracking: Once you’ve decided on your activities for the day, you wind up the timer for 25 minutes and then start in on the first one. During every 25-minute timebox—called a Pomodoro—you collect a small amount of process metrics. You may, for example, count the number of times that you get interrupted.\
Recording: At the end of the day, you file your daily observations on the Records sheet. If you tracked the number of interruptions, then this number is saved here.\
Processing: After recording, you convert the raw data into information. For example, you might calculate how many interruptions you get in an average 25-minute timebox.\
Visualizing: Finally, you organize the information in a way that helps you see how to improve your process. This is basically a daily retrospective and when you acclimatize your working habits to your reality.\
Every day starts with the Planning stage and ends with Recording, Processing, and Visualizing stages. In between, there is an iterative loop of 25-minute Tracking sessions.",

It depends on what you do and who you are, including where you work and how you feel. Complex problems may demand longer breaks. If you’re tired one day, that can also be a reason to lengthen the breaks.\
However, if breaks are too long, then you will lose the rhythm. Every Pomodoro start will feel like starting on a new activity. If you skip breaks, on the other hand, then quality will fall. You will get an attention deficit that you must pay for later the same day. Furthermore, if you randomly mix long and short breaks, you will not feel motivated to wind up the clock. The setup time will increase, since it’s all about biological rhythms.",

Start from the top.\
Take one thing at a time.\
Never put something back into the inbox.\
I think about the next action for every new email. If it takes a minute or less to answer, then I’ll do it immediately. If I can delegate it further, then I delegate it right now. When I know it’s an activity that I will do but that takes a little longer, then I don’t start it now. I write the item on my Activity Inventory sheet, move the email to an archive folder, and mentally drop the activity.\
Activities that I can’t do because I need information from other people are similar to the delegated activities. I’ll send the request to that person and then move the email to an archive folder.\
I also always think about whether I will benefit from this email in the future; otherwise, I delete it immediately. Loads of emails that will never lead to any action creates information overflow. It hides the emails that are new, that are important, and that really require action",

Use the back side of the To Do Today sheet, and rotate it 90 degrees so it is in landscape orientation. Now you’re ready to explore your mind in order to grasp at the most usable knowledge concluded today.\
This is how I do the next step: in the middle of the paper, I draw a picture of my daily subject. What’s my daily subject? What have I been communicating most with colleagues today? What’s the keyword of the activity with most Xs drawn today? What was the subject of the meetings I went to today? What tool did I use in a new way today? Those are a lot of questions with possibly many answers. I have to choose one single thing as my daily subject. I pick the first one that pops up in mind and that feels outstanding in some aspect.\
Then I draw an ordinary mind map with colored branches, small icons, and free associations. When the timer rings, I just put the To Do Today sheet with my daily mind map into my pile of past daily mind maps.
